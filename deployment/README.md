# Fleetmetrics Deployment
Fleetmetrics deploys all services with Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. We provide container images in DockerHub or your can roll your own. This folder provides examples of manual deployment of Dockers, Kubernetes as well as creating resources in Aws or Azure. We are working on the GitLab CI/CD yaml.
